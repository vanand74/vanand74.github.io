            <h2>Stuff I'm Into</h2>
            <p>
                I'm really into motorcycling. I have 3 bikes (two street bikes and a dirt bike). People often ask me why
                I "need" more than one motorcycle. In response, I ask them why they need more than one pair of shoes. Or why
                they need more than one shirt. I have done plenty of track days, and have even raced a few times.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to riding, I love watching racing. Some series I follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.motogp.com/" target="_blank">MotoGP</a>. MotoGP is like Formula 1 for motorcycles. But more exciting. Even F1 drivers
                    have said so! My favorite riders at the moment are Fabio Quartararo, Marc Marquez, and Cal Crutchlow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.worldsbk.com/" target="_blank">World Superbike</a>. World Superbike uses modified production bikes. The racing
                    is really good. Riders I like: Jonathan Rea, Chaz Davies, and Scott Redding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.supercrosslive.com/" target="_blank">Supercross</a>. Supercross is dirt bike racing inside a stadium or on a manmade course. It's
                    incredibly exciting with the jumping. I try to go to one or two races a year, usually St. Louis or Indianapolis.
                    My favorite riders are Eli Tomac, Marvin Musquin, and Jason Anderson.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://motoamerica.com/" target="_blank">MotoAmerica</a>. MotoAmerica is an American racing series. It's great
                    to see a resurgence of racing in the U.S. and I hope we produce some talent for the world stage. There's a kid,
                    Rocco Landers, who I think has the talent to become an international star. He won the MotoAmerican Junior Cup last
                    season and will compete in Europe in 2020. Go Rocco!
